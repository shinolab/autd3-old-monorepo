# Julia

[AUTD3.jl](https://github.com/shinolab/autd3/tree/master/julia) provides a wrapper for Julia.

## Installation

You can install it from GitHub repository.

```
(v1.7) pkg> add https://github.com/shinolab/autd3.git:julia
```

## Usage

The wrapper is designed to be the same as the C++ version.

For example, the following code is equivalent to [Getting Started](../Users_Manual/getting_started.md).

```julia
{{#include ../../../samples/julia/sample.jl}}
```

For a more detailed sample, see [example in AUTD3.jl](https://github.com/shinolab/autd3/tree/master/julia/example).
