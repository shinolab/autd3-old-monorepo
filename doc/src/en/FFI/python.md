# python

[pyautd](https://github.com/shinolab/autd3/tree/master/python) provides a wrapper for python.

## Installation

[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyautd3/) package is available; you can install it from pip.

```
pip install pyautd3
```

Or you can install it from the autd3 repository.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/shinolab/autd3.git#subdirectory=python
```

### Linux/macOS

If you are using Linux/macOS, you may need administrator privileges.
In that case, install with administrator privileges.

```
sudo pip install pyautd3
```

## Usage

The python version is designed to be basically the same as the C++ version.

For example, the following code is equivalent to [Getting Started](../Users_Manual/getting_started.md).

```python
{{#include ../../../samples/python/main.py}}
```

See [pyautd example](https://github.com/shinolab/autd3/tree/master/python/example) for more detail.

## Troubleshooting

Q. I can't run the program from Linux or mac.

A. Run as administrator.

```
sudo python
```
