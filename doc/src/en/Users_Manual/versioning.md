# Versioning

AUTD3 follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) from v8.2.0.

## Firmware version

On the other hand, the firmware version does not follow semantic versioning.
The firmware version is v2.x.y.
Here, x of the firmware represents the major version, and the compatibility between different x is not guaranteed.
Also, y represents the patch version, which is raised when there is a bug fix that maintains compatibility.
