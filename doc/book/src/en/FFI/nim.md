# Nim

[autd3_sim](https://github.com/shinolab/autd3/tree/master/nim) provides a wrapper for Nim.

## Installation

You can install it with nimble.

```
requires "https://github.com/shinolab/autd3.git?subdir=nim == 8.3.0"
```

## Usage

The wrapper is designed to be the same as the C++ version.

For example, the following code is equivalent to [Getting Started](../Users_Manual/getting_started.md).


```nim
{{#include ../../../samples/nim/sample/src/sample.nim}}
```

For a more detailed example, see [example](https://github.com/shinolab/autd3/tree/master/nim/examples).
