# AUTD3 for Arduino

This is AUTD3 library for Arduino.

# Dependencies

* [SOEM4Arduino](https://github.com/lipoyang/SOEM4Arduino)

# Example

* focus
    - Send `f` to generate focus and `q` to stop autd.

# Limitation

* Functionality is very limited.

* It is impractical to use a microcontroller to calculate the phase of transducers. Therefore, this library requires the pre-computed phase.

* It has not been tested very well.
